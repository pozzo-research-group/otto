The units of the time delay are in units of the **action_time** which is the amount of time it takes in seconds to perform one action. More information on this can be found in the next section. "

The first column of the direction_array variable contains information on the volume that needs to be transferred. The second column contains information on the sample number. The third column contains information on the stock number to use. A row that contains negative numbers means that the OT2 will not perform any action for a duration equal to the absolute value of the negative number multiplied by the time it takes to perform one action.
