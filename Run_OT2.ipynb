    "The function CD.create_directions will transform the volume, time, and order arrays into a single array with the directions that the OT2 can follow. The OT2 will perform one action (pick up tip - transfer stock to destination - drop tip) per row and every action will take the same amount of time which can be set by the keyword argument **action_time**. The first column of the direction_array variable contains information on the volume that needs to be transferred. The second column contains information on the sample number. The third column contains information on the stock number to use. A row that contains negative numbers means that the OT2 will not perform any action for a duration equal to the absolute value of the negative number multiplied by the time it takes to perform one action. Any sample with a volume = 0 and time_delay = 0, will be completely ignored. "
